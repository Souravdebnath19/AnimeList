                                series Naruto. He is a cheerful, hyperactive, strong-willed, and occasionally
                                simple-minded young shinobi from the village of Konoha (or Leaf Village).</p>
                            <p>Since Naruto has the Nine Tails Fox sealed inside him, he is able to use the Fox's
                                chakra, which is much greater than the average human. Initially Naruto and the Fox hated
                                each other, and would rarely grant Naruto his power
                                unless they were going to die. Eventually, they become friends, and Naruto then refers
                                to the fox by his name, Kurama. At this point, Naruto can use Kurama's chakra at will.

                              Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.
                              He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family,
                               the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years.
                               He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of her death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro.

                              Kiyotaka Ayanokōji (綾あやの小こう路じ 清きよ隆たか, Ayanokōji Kiyotaka) is the main protagonist of the You-Zitsu series.
                              He is currently a second-year student of Advanced Nurturing High School. Following the entrance exam in which he scored
                              precisely 50 points in every subject, he was placed in D-Class. In the anime adaptation, he sits at the rear left corner
                             of the class seat next to Suzune Horikita.
.</p>
                            <p>Kiyotaka is an inconspicuous and unobtrusive student, and while his grades are average (on purpose), he possesses a sagacious
                               ability to read the emotions of people around him with pinpoint accuracy and either helps or destroys them.[1]

                               He is well-versed in history as he has quoted many historical figures who are all well known for their intelligence.He tends to come up with ingenious and
                               imaginative plans such as using the school rules so that he could obtain old test questions from an older D-Class student by paying him 15,000 points.
                               He also used the rules and the purpose of points to bribe his teacher into stopping the expulsion of Ken Sudō.[5] In fact, it is hinted by a select few that
                               he could have easily been placed in a higher class like A-Class if he actually applied himself.

                              Ace was first shown during the Drum Island Arc, but only got formally introduced in the Arabasta Arc, where he acts as a brief ally of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is a central figure during the whole Summit War Saga. He is also the protagonist of Ace's Great Blackbeard Search Cover Page Serial.

Ace's death ultimately proved to be the catalyst leading to Luffy training for two years to become strong enough to protect his friends, paving the way for the second half of the series.

                                Sunshine, which made him renowned for gaining immense power during the day, and

                                with feelings. Both personalities seem to be truly him, and he remembers everything
                                he does in either, though at night he has chastised himself for losing control during
                                the day.

                              and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World.[3]
                              Sailing with the Roger Pirates since he was an infant, Shanks would begin his pirate career on their ship as an
                              apprentice alongside Buggy, before forming his own crew following Roger's death.[4]

                              Twelve years ago, while operating in the East Blue, Shanks sacrificed his left arm in order to save his young friend, Monkey D. Luffy, at sea. Notably, Shanks is the pirate who inspired Luffy to go on his own pirate journey,[13] as well as accidentally providing him with the Gomu Gomu no Mi to eat.[14] He also owned the Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday.

Ever since the beginning of the series, Shanks has been an important background character, usually being shown accompanying Luffy's ever-growing reputation as a pirate. He is a late, but still vital ally during both the Marineford and Wano Country Arcs. He and his crew also have a sizable role in One Piece Film: Red, which centers on Uta, Shanks' adoptive daughter.

He is one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".He became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea during the timeskip,but his position was revoked for allying with the Straw Hat Pirates.

                              Law is the only known survivor of Flevance, a town whose inhabitants suffered from a condition known as Amber Lead Syndrome. Because the disease was fatal and poorly understood, Flevance was destroyed by neighboring countries out of fear, with a young Law barely escaping alive.[7] He subsequently joined the Donquixote Pirates, where Donquixote Doflamingo intended to make Law one of his executive officers.[17] However, thanks to the efforts of Doflamingo's brother, Rosinante, Law was freed from the Donquixote Pirates' influence and became a pirate set to bring down Doflamingo's empire.

                                left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal
                                world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ，Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself,
                                Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his
                                machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War.

                                peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan,
                                his childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and the Uchiha clan. He would later become

                                of Konohagakure. Although he was not able
                                to achieve peace during his lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue
                                to shape the village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.

                                a boy his own age named Madara.

                                Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
                                Sharingan , he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice
                                and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on
                                Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson,
                                along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth
                                Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth
                                Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kakashi became a Jonin and was sent on a mission along with Obito and Rin, They where to
                                destroy a bridge that was being used by enemy forces to enter Konoha and therefore help
                                in the third great shinobi war effort. But disaster struck when Rin was taken
                                by two Iwagakure Jonin. Obito wanted to rescue his teammate; But Kakashi said that the
                                mission came first. Kakashi found himself in the same situation as his father had been
                                in the past and did not want to make the mistakes
                                that his father had. Obito disagreed and left Kakashi not before telling him that what
                                his father did in the past made him a hero not a disgrace.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Nagato (長門, Nagato) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan.
                                Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato
                                dreamed of bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's
                                death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading
                                a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nagato lived with his parents: Fusō and Ise on the outskirts of Amegakure. When he was
                                very young, Madara Uchiha secretly transplanted his Rinnegan into Nagato without his or
                                his parents' knowledge.[8] Sometime later, during the Second Shinobi World War,
                                Nagato and his parents took shelter in their home to avoid the fighting going on around
                                them.

                                Restaurant Yukihira. He is a 92nd Tōtsuki Generation alumnus and a former resident of
                                Polar Star Dormitory. He is also a previous 1st seat of the Elite Ten Council
                            </p>

                                Sōma's main outfit is his Restaurant Yukihira cooking uniform, consisting of a black
                                shirt with the restaurant's logo on the back and left chest area of his shirt. Whenever
                                he cooks, he wears a white apron over his waist. While at Tōtsuki, Sōma wears
                                a black coat summer school uniform over his Yukihira cooking uniform. Sōma also ties his
                                trademark white headband around his forehead whenever he cooks. If he is not cooking or
                                bathing, he wears his headband around his
                                left wrist. Compared to his fellow Tōtsuki students, Sōma dresses very casually; in his
                                free time, he sports a hanten jacket with a simple white shirt beneath it and a striped
                                track pants at his places of residence. Sōma
                                states that dressing in his hanten calms him down.

                                Rimuru is an eccentric and childish person by nature but this shouldn't be mistaken for immaturity and naivety.
                                Underneath the surface Rimuru is constantly analyzing, planning, and weighing the pros and cons of his actions,
                                 taking the smart move in the long-term over more rash and emotional decisions. In stark contrast to this normally composed and
                                  calculative demeanor, he's absolutely ruthless when it comes to handling people who have angered him. He'll go as far as brutal
                                   torture and murder without batting an eye if he can get away with it and uses more subtle methods like intimidation and blackmail

                                Anos Voldigoad (アノス・ヴォルディゴード Anosu Vorudigōdo?) is a powerful demon who was infamously
                                known during the Mythical Age as the Demon King of Tyranny (暴虐の魔王 Bōgyaku no Maō?), for
                                his immense power and cruelty towards his enemies. After giving up his life
                                to separate the world into four, he reincarnated into the Magical Age and began
                                attending the Demon King Academy, only to be branded as a misfit. He is the titular
                                protagonist of the The Misfit of Demon King Academy.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anos is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny two
                                thousand years ago. He is resolute, stalwart, and invincible. His absolute power instils
                                a veritable self-confidence that is only surpassed by his ego. Because of his
                                overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easygoing attitude and an unrivaled sense of
                                perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way. Despite being called the
                                Demon King of Tyranny, Anos has a definitive moral
                                compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the
                                well-being of not only his family, but also his friends and followers, and is quick to
                                reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to
                                go through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach
                                their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not
                                to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never
                                admit it, Anos is very protective of his fellow friends and followers. While Anos is not
                                inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his
                                enemies, earned him his title. While he originally
                                never proclaimed himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the
                                world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the
                                mere fact that a single man possesses such
                                power. The legends of his gaze striking fear into those who appear before him are not
                                just a rumor either. Just using his Magic Eyes to control others' actions is enough for
                                some to go mentally insane.

                                Shōyō Hinata is the main protagonist of the Haikyū!! series by Haruichi Furudate. Shoyo
                                is a high school student who wishes to become like the "Small Giant," a former Karasuno
                                High School student and volleyball club member. To achieve his dream, he decides
                                to join Karasuno, but to join the volleyball team he and Tobio Kageyama, his old
                                opponent in a volleyball match, must overcome their rivalry and work together. For the
                                majority of the series, Hinata was a first-year student
                                at Karasuno High and one of the volleyball team's middle blockers. Hinata has a cheerful
                                and energetic personality. Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was
                                young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate
                                for his lack of height.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He is easily excited and can be quite loud. For the most part, Hinata is very
                                simple-minded which sometimes causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also
                                shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and can be incredibly
                                empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to
                                hear to push themselves in the right direction. His friendly and straightforward
                                personality allows him to befriend even the quietest
                                of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.
                                Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it
                                comes to volleyball. Hinata has a very big fortitude
                                to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice
                                match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when
                                people underestimate him.
